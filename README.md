# Image-Captioning-Bot
Image Captioning is a problem of generating a caption for a given image using Deep Learning.

The motivation behind the project:
This project can be used as a base for more complex projects like 
- Automatic surveillance using CCTV cameras to detect crimes/accidents.
- Aid to the blind people by using a camera to detect scenes in front of them.
- Automatic Captioning can help, make Google Image Search as good as Google Search, as then every image could be first converted into a caption and then search can be performed based on the caption.

# Dataset 
Dataset used is Flickr8k Dataset available on kaggle. It have 8K images and every image has 5 captions so that makes it 8000*5 = captions.

# Model insights

# Training
I trained my model on google colab. This is the most critical part. You need to be very patient while training your model. It took me around 15-16 hours of training while I was trying for different hyper_parameters.
