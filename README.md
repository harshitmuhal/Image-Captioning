The motivation behind the project:<br><br>
This project can be used as a base for more complex projects like 
- Automatic surveillance using CCTV cameras to detect crimes/accidents.
- Aid to the blind people by using a camera to detect scenes in front of them.
- Automatic Captioning can help, make Google Image Search as good as Google Search, as then every image could be first converted into a caption and then search can be performed based on the caption.
